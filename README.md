First repository of a specialist in International Relations, who eagerly wants to be in IT

Hi! My name is Vadim!

I have plenty of ideas in digital segment, yet lack tech-skills and experience to implement them in life quickly and effectively.

So, I learn a bit of code and design to prototype my first apps.

You are all welcome to write me down - if you have spare time and tech-skills, I believe we can cooperate and have a win0win situation!

See you!
